###Race###

map for race in Hampden county by tract
```{r}
#getting all the variables for race from census
racevars <- c(White = "B02001_002", 
              Black = "B02001_003",

              Native_american = "B02001_004",
              Native_hawaian = "B02001_006",
              someOtherRace = "B02001_007")

race_tract <- get_acs(geography = "tract", variables = racevars, 
                  state = "MA", county = "Hampden County", geometry = TRUE,
                  summary_var = "B01003_001")  #what is the summary variable again

county_race_map <- race_tract %>%
                      mutate(pct = 100 * (estimate /summary_est)) %>% #moe in the df is margin of error
                      ggplot(aes(fill = pct)) + #is a continuous scale so can't have discrete values
                      facet_wrap(~variable) +
                      geom_sf(color = NA) +
                      coord_sf(crs = 26918) + 
                      scale_fill_viridis_c()

class(county_race_map)

county_race_map

```

map for race by place- problem is that place is available by state, not county so we get map of the entire state- not helpful
```{r}
race_place <- get_acs(geography = "place", variables = racevars, 
                  state = "MA", geometry = TRUE,
                  summary_var = "B01003_001")  #what is the summary variable again

race_place %>%
  mutate(pct = 100 * (estimate /summary_est)) %>% #moe in the df is margin of error
  ggplot(aes(fill = pct)) + #is a continuous scale so can't have discrete values
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  geom_sf(color = NA) +
  coord_sf(crs = 26918) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c()

```

race maps with cities more clear
```{r}
race_block <- get_acs(geography = "block group", variables = racevars, 
                  state = "MA", county = "Hampden County",geometry = TRUE,
                  summary_var = "B01003_001")  #summary variable is total pop

options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

race_block %>%
  mutate(pct = 100 * (estimate /summary_est)) %>% #moe in the df is margin of error
  ggplot(aes(fill = pct)) + #is a continuous scale so can't have discrete values
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  geom_sf(color = NA) +
  coord_sf(crs = 26918) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c()

```

1. ss of race maps with cities + legends only
2. add to dashboard with text
3. see video on leaflet/mapview interaction with shiny
4. add city polygons to maps to highlight them
5. create charts for income (bar chart)
6. create charts for education levels (bar charts)
7. make dashboard so that each factor chart aligns with each factor's map
